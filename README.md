#Purpose

To undertake the course project for Getting and Cleaning Data course on Coursera

#Goal

Per the course project instructions, conduct the full process of reading, loading the Samsung sensor data set and all the ensuing measures necessary for generating a tidy data set. It is mean to demonstrate the student’s knowledge of the whole process of tidying data set

#Key steps

Read and load the Samsung data set and the reshape2 package for R required for carrying out melt and cast functions;
Create one R script called run_analysis.R;
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set;
Extracts only the mean and standard deviation measurement out of the original data set. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set, and fine-tune the variable names to go with the variable naming protocols as laid out by Google’s R style guide (https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rguide.xml);
Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
